# Group Vision Web

Have you ever wanted to split up but can’t keep track of your friends? No need to worry! Group Vision is a quick and simple way to stay connected. The process is fast and intuitive - simply create a username and you’re in! No need to login or create an account. Instantly create groups with an automated 4 digit group code! Join groups by entering in an existing group code. View your groups’ locations in real-time on a single map. Check when their locations were last updated so you’ll know if your friends went off the grid! Control when you want your location to be tracked - Group Vision will be disabled when you close the app!

With Group Vision, you can:
- Create or join groups with an automated group code
- See all your friends’ locations on a single map
- Tap on markers to see others’ usernames and the time last updated for their location
- Share the group code with your friends
- Leave or Join new groups at any time
- Change your username whenever you want
